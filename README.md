This project was to be a semester-long project in CS309 but was abandoned halfway through the semester because the rest of the
group dropped.
# Goal
To create a multiplayer strategy game as an Android app with communication using SQL in which players purchase squads
of npcs and use them to engage other players in combat with the goal of defeating all other players. The project was to have 
matchmaking, multiplayer lobbies, messaging, and lobby hosting.
#Contributions
I worked on the majority of the backend working with controllers and storing basic data, as was expected early into the class.
Tony worked on the majority of the frontend making the game work in Android.
Aiden worked on the minority of backend, struggling to balance the project with other classes.
John worked on the vast minority of frontend, doing almost nothing until he dropped after not communicating for weeks.

I fortunately found a new group after losing this group.
This project could have been something great if the whole group contributed and I hope to do something with it one day.
